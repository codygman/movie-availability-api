Gokogiri 
by Zhigang Chen and Hampton Catlin

A pretty straightforward and simple library for using LibXML in native Go.

This is a major rewrite from v0 in the following places:

    - Separation of XML and HTML
    - Put more burden of memory allocation/deallocation on Go
    - Fragement parsing -- no more deep-copy
    - Serialization
    - Some API adjustment
