movie-availability-api
======================

This is an api which looks up availability information on popular movie services:

- crackle 
- youtube 
- hulu 
- itunes 

It was made for http://www.hubster.tv. Hubster loves open source and startups so we decided to
let everyone use this :)

If you decide to use our API for your startup, let us know and maybe we can help. We're also
interested to see what others may create with this!

## TODO
